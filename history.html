          <h4>Our Beginning</h4>\\\\\
          Prophet's Companions Orphanage was founded in 1995 by Dr. Amal Hassan,
          a compassionate doctor who saw firsthand the need for a safe space for
          abandoned and orphaned children in Cairo. Witnessing the hardships
          faced by vulnerable children in her community, Dr. Hassan was inspired
          to create a sanctuary where they could find shelter, love, and
          opportunities for a brighter future. The orphanage began in a small
          rented house with only a handful of children, but it was filled with
          hope, resilience, and the dream of making a difference.

          <h4>Growing to Meet the Need</h4>
          Over the years, Prophet's Companions Orphanage expanded, responding to
          a growing need for safe shelter and holistic care for vulnerable
          children. Thanks to generous support from local and international
          donors, we were able to move to a larger facility in 2002, complete
          with dormitories, a school room, and a small clinic. Our team grew as
          well, with experienced educators, caregivers, and healthcare providers
          joining to meet the needs of each child. Today, we are proud to care
          for over 100 children, providing them with a safe and nurturing
          environment.

          <h4>Milestones Along the Way</h4>
          In 2008, we celebrated the opening of our Learning Center, allowing us
          to offer on-site classes and after-school tutoring to help each child
          reach their academic potential. In 2015, we launched our Skills for
          Life program, where older children learn valuable life skills, from
          budgeting to cooking and career planning. The success of this program
          has inspired many graduates to pursue higher education and careers in
          Egypt and abroad.
