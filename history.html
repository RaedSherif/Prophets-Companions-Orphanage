                    Daar Rofaqa el Nabi was founded in 1995 by Dr. Amal Hassan, a compassionate doctor who saw firsthand the need for a safe space for abandoned and orphaned children in Cairo. Witnessing the hardships faced by vulnerable children in her community, Dr. Hassan was inspired to create a sanctuary where they could find shelter, love, and opportunities for a brighter future. The orphanage began in a small rented house with only a handful of children, but it was filled with hope, resilience, and the dream of making a difference.</td>

                <td class="td2"><h4>Growing to Meet the Need</h4>
                    Over the years, Daar Rofaqa el Nabi expanded, responding to a growing need for safe shelter and holistic care for vulnerable children. Thanks to generous support from local and international donors, we were able to move to a larger facility in 2002, complete with dormitories, a school room, and a small clinic. Our team grew as well, with experienced educators, caregivers, and healthcare providers joining to meet the needs of each child. Today, we are proud to care for over 100 children, providing them with a safe and nurturing environment.

                    In 2008, we celebrated the opening of our Learning Center, allowing us to offer on-site classes and after-school tutoring to help each child reach their academic potential. In 2015, we launched our Skills for Life program, where older children learn valuable life skills, from budgeting to cooking and career planning. The success of this program has inspired many graduates to pursue higher education and careers in Egypt and abroad.</td>
