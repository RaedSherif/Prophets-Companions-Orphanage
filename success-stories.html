                <td class="td2">Ahmed came to Prophet’s Companions Orphanage at the age of 8. Shy and reserved, he faced challenges both emotionally and academically. Our team worked closely with him, helping him gain confidence and develop a love for learning. Over time, Ahmed began excelling in his studies and discovered a passion for science. Through mentorship and tutoring, he not only caught up in school but eventually graduated at the top of his class. Today, Ahmed is attending university on a scholarship, studying to become a doctor. He often returns to the orphanage to share his story and inspire other children to pursue their dreams.</td>

                <td class="td2">Salma’s Story: Finding a Voice and Inspiring Others</td>
                <td class="td2">When Salma arrived at Prophet’s Companions Orphanage at the age of 11, she had a love for drawing but was too shy to express herself openly. Our staff encouraged her creativity, providing her with art supplies and enrolling her in art workshops. With time, Salma blossomed into a talented artist, using her work to convey her feelings and experiences. Her paintings have been displayed in community art exhibits, and she even held her first solo exhibition at 16. Now a young adult, Salma is pursuing a career in art therapy, hoping to help other children express themselves through creativity, just as she was encouraged to do.</td>

                <td class="td2">Omar came to the orphanage as a teenager after losing his parents. Struggling with grief, he found it difficult to connect with others. The staff at Prophet’s Companions Orphanage introduced him to sports as an outlet, and Omar developed a love for soccer. With his dedication and hard work, he became captain of the local youth soccer team, where he discovered a talent for leadership. Today, Omar is a coach for younger children and an active community volunteer. His journey from heartbreak to leadership has inspired others, and he’s proud to be a role model for the next generation at the orphanage.</td>

                <td class="td2">Hanan, a bright young girl, struggled with self-confidence and had difficulty adjusting to a structured school environment. At Prophet’s Companions Orphanage, she received one-on-one tutoring and counseling to help her discover her strengths. Her teachers noticed her keen interest in mathematics and encouraged her to pursue it. Over the years, Hanan excelled in math competitions, even representing her school at the national level. Now in her final year of high school, Hanan plans to study engineering and hopes to give back by creating educational programs for girls interested in STEM fields.</td>

                <td class="td2">Khalid, who arrived at the orphanage at a young age, rarely spoke. The trauma he had experienced had left him withdrawn and unable to connect with his peers. One of the caregivers noticed his interest in music, and with time, Khalid was introduced to various musical instruments. He discovered a love for the oud, a traditional Middle Eastern instrument. Music became Khalid’s way to communicate and heal. Today, Khalid performs at community events and volunteers to teach music to younger children, spreading joy and hope through his melodies.</td>
